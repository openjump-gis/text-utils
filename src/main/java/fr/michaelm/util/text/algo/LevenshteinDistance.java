/**
 * The LevenshteinDistance is the number of changes needed to change one String
 * into another, where each change is a single character modification (deletion,
 * insertion or substitution).
 *
 * <p>This implementation, is the one proposed by Chas Emerick for the Apache
 * Commons Lang library.</p>
 * <p>It is based on Michael Gilleland implementation, but it is more memory 
 * efficient for large strings.</p>
 * <p>See also <a href="http://www.merriampark.com/ldjava.htm">
 * http://www.merriampark.com/ldjava.htm</a></p>
 * 
 * <p>The difference between this implementation and the classical one is
 * that, rather than creating and retaining a matrix of size s.length()+1 by
 * t.length()+1, we maintain two single-dimensional arrays of length s.length()+1.
 * The first, d, is the 'current working' distance array that maintains the
 * newest distance cost counts as we iterate through the characters of String s.
 * Each time we increment the index of String t we are comparing, d is copied to
 * p, the second int[]. Doing so allows us to retain the previous cost counts as
 * required by the algorithm (taking the minimum of the cost count to the left,
 * up one, and diagonally up and to the left of the current cost count being
 * calculated). (Note that the arrays aren't really copied anymore, just
 * switched...this is clearly much better than cloning an array or doing a 
 * System.arraycopy() each time  through the outer loop.)</p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * In order to normalize the result, distance returns the ratio between the
 * edit number and the longest string.
